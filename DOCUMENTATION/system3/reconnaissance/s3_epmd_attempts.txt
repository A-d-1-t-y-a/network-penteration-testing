System 3: epmd Investigation Attempts
Date: 2025-11-18

Attempts:
1. epmd -names -host 10.10.11.86
   - Result: Command not found (erlang-base package 404 errors from Kali repos)
   - Status: Failed due to repository issues

2. echo "names" | nc 10.10.11.86 4369
   - Result: No output shown (may need different approach)
   - Status: Needs verification

3. Port scan (4000-4010, 8000-8010):
   - Result: All ports closed
   - Status: No additional Erlang ports found in common ranges

4. Web endpoint tests:
   - /api/ → 404 Not Found
   - /health → 404 Not Found  
   - /status → 404 Not Found
   - Status: Backend is responding (404 vs previous 504 timeout - progress!)

Analysis:
- Backend service is now responding (changed from 504 to 404)
- Common endpoints don't exist
- Need to find correct endpoints via directory enumeration
- epmd query failed due to tool availability, not network issues

Next steps:
- Try netcat with different epmd query format
- Access root path again (may work now)
- Comprehensive directory enumeration with ffuf
- Check for common Phoenix/Elixir paths
