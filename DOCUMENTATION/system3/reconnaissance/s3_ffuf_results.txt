assets [Status: 301, Size: 178, Words: 6, Lines: 8, Duration: 329ms]

Summary:
- Only one valid path found: /assets (301 redirect)
- All other common paths return 404 or timeout
- Backend service is intermittent (504 Gateway Timeout on root path)
- Application appears to be minimal or requires specific conditions to access

Next steps (when returning to this system):
- Check /assets directory contents
- Try larger wordlist (directory-list-2.3-medium.txt or big.txt)
- Investigate if application needs specific headers or conditions
- Check if there's a registration/login flow that needs to be triggered
- Consider that this might be a more advanced machine requiring specific techniques
