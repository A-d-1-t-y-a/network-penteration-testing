System 3: Soulmate Web Analysis
Date: 2025-11-18
IP: 10.10.11.86

Findings:
1. Hosts file updated: soulmate.htb -> 10.10.11.86 ✓

2. Redirect behavior:
   - Direct IP access: 302 redirect to http://soulmate.htb/
   - This confirms virtual host configuration

3. Gateway Timeout (504):
   - Both curl -L and Host header requests result in 504 Gateway Timeout
   - nginx/1.18.0 is running but backend service is not responding
   - This suggests:
     a) Backend Erlang/Phoenix app needs initialization time
     b) Backend service might be on a different port
     c) Backend might require specific conditions to start

4. Port 4369 (epmd):
   - Confirmed: Erlang Port Mapper Daemon
   - This indicates Erlang/Elixir application stack
   - epmd manages Erlang node connections

5. Service Architecture:
   - Frontend: nginx (reverse proxy)
   - Backend: Erlang/Phoenix application (not responding)
   - Port mapper: epmd on 4369

Next investigation steps:
- Wait and retry (some HTB machines need warm-up time)
- Check for other Erlang ports (epmd can reveal node ports)
- Try different HTTP methods (POST, OPTIONS)
- Check for API endpoints or alternative paths
- Investigate epmd to find actual application ports
