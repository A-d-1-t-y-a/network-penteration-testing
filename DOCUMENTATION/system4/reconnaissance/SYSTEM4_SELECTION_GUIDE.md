# System 4 Selection Guide

## Recommendation: Stay with HackTheBox

**Why:**
- ✅ Already set up (VPN, account, machines spawned)
- ✅ Consistent documentation format
- ✅ No additional account setup needed
- ✅ You have 3 HTB systems already documented

## What to Look For

Since you're short on time, choose an **easier/older** machine:

### Criteria:
1. **Release Date**: 2023 or earlier (OK for 4th system - requirement is "at least 3 from last 3 months")
2. **Difficulty**: Easy or Medium
3. **User Rating**: 4+ stars
4. **Active Users**: High user count (indicates machine is working)
5. **OS**: Different from your other systems (you have: Linux, Windows, Linux - so Windows would be good)

### How to Find Good Machines:

1. Go to HackTheBox → Machines → All
2. Sort by "User Rating" (highest first)
3. Filter by "Easy" or "Medium" difficulty
4. Look for machines released 2023 or earlier
5. Check that it's different from your other systems

### Examples of Good Choices:
- Windows machines (you only have 1 Windows so far - Signed)
- Machines with different services (SMB, FTP, RDP, etc.)
- Popular machines with many solves

## Alternative: TryHackMe (If You Want Variety)

**Pros:**
- Beginner-friendly
- Guided walkthroughs
- Web-based access

**Cons:**
- Requires account setup (takes time)
- More web-focused (less network pentesting)
- Different documentation format

**If you choose TryHackMe:**
- Look for rooms with "Network" or "Active Directory" tags
- Choose "Easy" or "Medium" difficulty
- Ensure it's from last 3 months (if you want it to count as recent)

## Current Systems Summary

- **System 1**: Editor (HTB) - Linux - Web + XWiki
- **System 2**: Signed (HTB) - Windows - MSSQL
- **System 3**: Soulmate (HTB) - Linux - Web + Erlang

**For System 4, consider:**
- Windows machine (to balance OS diversity)
- Different services (SMB, FTP, RDP, etc.)
- Easier difficulty (to ensure completion)

## Decision

**My recommendation: Stay with HTB, choose an easier Windows machine from 2023 or earlier.**

This ensures:
- ✅ Quick start (no new account setup)
- ✅ Consistent documentation
- ✅ OS diversity (2 Windows, 2 Linux)
- ✅ Higher chance of completion (easier machine)
